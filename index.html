        <h4>Tuesday</h4>
        <p>
          Everyone‚Äôs welcome to a ‚Äòwelcome drinks‚Äô and a light buffet on Tuesday evening. It‚Äôll be
          from 7:30pm and in central Sarajevo. Exact time and place to be confirmed!
        </p>
        <h4>Wednesday</h4>
        <p>
          We‚Äôll be arranging a walking tour of Sarajevo on Wednesday, for those who want to join. We‚Äôve shared some
          restaurant
          recommendations for your Wednesday evening too.
        </p>
        <h4>Thursday</h4>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs wedding day! We‚Äôll be getting married in the afternoon. The starting point is in walking distance from
          all central Sarajevo hotels, or a very short taxi ride away.
        </p>
        <h4>Friday</h4>
        <p>
          Our time together comes to an end. We‚Äôll be arranging buses to Croatia, for anyone who fancies a short beach
          holiday to finish off the week. (Exact details on this to follow.)

          We will be getting married at <a class="in-text"
            href="https://www.worldjewishtravel.org/listing/sarajevo-ashkenazi-synagogue/" target="_blank">Sarajevo
            synagogue</a>. It is the first wedding there for around 30 years. We will
          be having a Jewish wedding ceremony. We expect the wedding ceremony to start in the early afternoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the ceremony and <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/food/articles/the-classic-kiddush-trio"
            target="_blank" class="in-text">Kiddush</a> in the Synagogue garden, we will head to Hotel Europe for our
          wedding party.
          The Hotel is a 10 minute walk down the road, in the centre of town.
        </p>
        <p>The wedding will finish around 12:30 / 1:00 a.m.</p>
        <h3> Dress Code </h3>
        <p>Sometimes referred to as lounge suits and cocktail dresses, otherwise known as fun and a little bit fancy. No
          black tie or anything like that required. But also probably not tracksuit bottoms. Colourful suits and dresses
          welcome.

        <p>
          All flights to Sarajevo are indirect at the moment (often via Zurich, Vienna or Frankfurt).
        </p>
        <p>
          Wizz Air used to fly direct from London, but unfortunately these flights were unceremoniously halted
          this winter just after we had confirmed our plans. There are rumours that Ryanair will pick up the mantle, but
          it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed yet. So your guess is as good as ours.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be worth booking your indirect flights now to grab what you can, or
          you might want to see what happens in the next few months and see if any airline picks up the direct
          London-Sarajevo flight path. (Although this would be the gamblers' strategy).

            You can enjoy a 30% discount discount as guests for our wedding. You just need to let the hotel know that
            you are coming for ‚ÄúMak and Vanessa‚Äôs Wedding on 15th June‚Äù.
            This one can't be beat for convenience (given it is also the venue).
          </p>
          <p>
            The hotel is a hybrid of an older Austro-Hungarian section and a slightly garish modern section. If luck is
            on your side your room will be in the older part. (We have asked the hotel to set aside some rooms in the
            older part for our guests.)

              This is mid range and great because it has a hamam spa in the basement where you can pay for treatments
              and make free use of the sauna / steam rooms. Also very close to the wedding and centre of town.

              We stayed here last year. It‚Äôs quite small and simple, but very comfortable - and the owner is
              exceptionally nice and the hotel has a very interesting and inspiring story. It's also right in the centre
              of town too.

              Full disclosure we haven‚Äôt actually stayed here, but we have eaten at the restaurant that this place is
              known for (and it was excellent). It's up on a very steep hill, so you‚Äôd have to either have strong legs
              or be happy to take a taxi to get back, but it seemed great and has beautiful views of the city.

          <h4>ƒÜevapi</h4>
          <img class="small" src="images/cevapi.jpg">
          <p>The unassuming ƒÜevap: a simple dish of grilled meatballs, served with bread, onion and sour cream. This
            dish may not perhaps seem to merit being a national obsession, <a href="https://mubi.com/films/deset-u-pola"
              target="_blank" class="in-text">film subject</a> or hallmark of Sarajevo. But it is.</p>
          <p>Where to find the best ƒáevapi is a debate which has never ended. If you want to join it, you can try one

          <h4>Pita</h4>
          <img style="object-position: 0 20%;" src="images/pita.png">
          <p>Not the delicious circular bread from the middle east. No, pita is in fact a family of dishes: pastries
            made from a thin flaky dough with a variety of different possible fillings. It's similar to borek (and in
            fact
            "burek" in Bosnia refers specifically to pita with a meat filling). </p>
          <p>
            The most common fillings are cheese ("sirnica"), spinach ("zeljanica") or meat (the aforementioned "burek").
            A great place to try it is the restaurant <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Kj8U86kY3Yfmk4Kk9"

          <h3>Restaurants</h3>

          <p>All of the below are pretty popular, so booking in advance is probably necessary.</p>

          <img class="small" style="object-position: 0% 70%;" src="images/restaurants.png">

          <h4>Kibe Mahala</h4>
          <p class="entry-details">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.restaurantkibe.com/">https://www.restaurantkibe.com/</a> |
            <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/2woSHr2B4bELduTJA">Map</a>
          </p>
          <p>Also in the hotel recommendations, but the restaurant here is the main event. Great views and a specialist
            in more traditional and robust fare (meaning also fewer vegetarian options unfortunately).</p>

          <h4>Dveri</h4>
          <p class="entry-details">
            <a target="_blank" href="http://dveri.co.ba/?lang=en">http://dveri.co.ba/</a> |
            <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/R4SiwGwBSreEW3F47">Map</a>
          </p>
          <p>Right in the centre of old town, a really cosy place with great food and wine.</p>

          <h4>The Singing Nettle</h4>
          <p class="entry-details">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thesingingnettle.com/">https://www.thesingingnettle.com/</a> |

          </p>
          <p>Modernised spins on traditional dishes. Lots of vegetarian options available here (and a somewhat
            vegetarian decor to match).</p>

        </section>

        <h3>Places to go</h3>

        <h4>Old Town</h4>

        <img class="small" style="object-position: 0 30%;" src="images/old town.png">

        <p>The best place to go wandering around.</p>

        <h4>Cable car and mountains</h4>

        <img class="small" style="object-position: 0% 60%;" src="images/cable-car.png">

        <p>Amazing views and great walks around the mountains just outside of Sarajevo. You can walk all the way back
          down to town if you fancy a longer one, going past the abandoned old winter Olympics bobsleigh track.</p>


        <h3>Other tips</h3>
        <p class="emoji-icon">&#128184;</p>
        <p>You can pay with card in most places these days, but for some things (e.g. taxis) it's pretty much cash only,
          so it's always a good idea to have a bit of cash.</p>
        <p>You will likely want a taxi from the airport. It's hard to get BAM (Bosnian Marks) outside of Bosnia,
          so your best bet would be to get a small amount at the airport. (A taxi from the airport should cost ~20 BAM, but
          some
          cheeky drivers may try to charge you more.) </p>
        <p>BAM is fixed to the Euro at roughly 2 BAM = 1‚Ç¨, meaning that it's currently 10 BAM = ¬£4.50. In town you can
          withdraw from cash machines. Some will charge but there are others which don't, so you may
          need to shop around a bit to avoid paying a fee.</p>
        <p class="emoji-icon">&#127774;&#9748;</p>
        <p>Sarajevo is usually pretty warm in June, but it's also usually pretty unpredictable! It's probably not a bad
          idea to bring some slightly warmer clothes and perhaps an umbrella just in case.</p>
        <p>For the day of the wedding, check the forecast but there's a good chance you might want to bring a light
          jacket for the evening.</p>
        <p class="emoji-icon">&#128288;</p>
        <p>For reading place names and the like, Bosnian sounds pretty much like english. Except:
        <ul>
          <li>"j" actually sounds more like "y" or "i" (kind of like the "y" in "yesterday" or "spy").</li>
          <li>A "d≈æ" sounds like "j". (Leading to hilarious transliterations of "James Dean" as "D≈æejms Din")</li>
          <li>A "d" with a bar in it (ƒë) sounds kind of like a "g", like in "geo".</li>
          <li>"i" often sounds more like "e". (Like the role "i" plays in "pita").</li>
          <li>"c"s wearing hats (ƒá or ƒç) are "ch" sounds (like "chat").</li>
          <li>An s with a hat (≈°) is a "sh" sound (like "shoe").</li>
        </ul>
